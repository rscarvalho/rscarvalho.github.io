I am a software engineer with more than 8 years of software engineering experience developing large-scale web applications using the latest web technologies.

A programming language polyglot with a systems administration background, I can perform well with many programming languages, paradigms, and platforms.

I currently work as a Software Engineer at [HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com/), as parte of the awesome BizOps team. When I'm not at work, I like spending time with my daughters, hacking on open-source projects, and playing the bass.
